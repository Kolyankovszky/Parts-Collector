Idea:
Compilation of spare parts requirements based on exploded diagrams of industrial equipment.
The list is created by selecting the numbers representing the parts shown in the exploded view.

Process:
Register yourself or your company on the website.
After registration, you can enter the website and register your pumps. During registration, you will receive a list of your pumps, from which you can select the relevant equipment. Now you see the exploded view of the equipment, where the parts are marked with numbers. You select the required part, which is added to the list. You can choose several parts or you can choose a new pump, the parts of which you add to the list.
When you're done, click the bid button. On the next page, you will see your data and the assembled parts list. You can modify or supplement the data. You can edit the list as needed. As soon as you're done, click the send button. An email is created from the list and sent to the recipient. You can use the list again later, edit it and generate a new email from it. A list of the sent requests is created for later use.
